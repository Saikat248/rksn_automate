# rksn_automate

This repository contains automation code developed for the research paper titled "Exploring Enantioselectivity in Organocatalysis: Insights from Bonding and Energy Decomposition Analyses". 


The code automates the TS search method for all the conformers based on the product structure.

# Dependencies

Python (version >= 3.7 should work fine)
No python external library required.
Mainly tested with Anaconda Python.
Without Anaconda the automation script should run fine but need to change couple of things (see below).

## External Programmes
